DO NOT OPEN THESE HERE WITH ANY SORT OF EDITOR ESPECIALLY THE TEX FILES OR THEY WILL DUMP ALL THE ACCESSORY FILES HERE TOO!!!

on a side note it is also best practices to never edit templates directly anyways and if extensive alterations are needed make a entirely seperate NAME_Vx in case previous versions are possibly needed / wanted...

that is all
