# SassosTACW-Public

Technical and Creative Writings, just random ideas that I want to write with no promise of correctness or degree of finality... Ranges anywhere from LaTeX technical papers to random .txt notes to code examples of potential implementations.

# Overview of writings and brief descriptions:

## Creative or Philosophical Writing
Non-Technical or more subjective writing, less concerned about applicability and more just brainstorming & and attempt at categorizing some of the more chaotic parts of life into a more "understandable" format to hopefully make sense of it more.

## Guides and General HowTo
Stuff I have wished I learned / Have benefitted from writing down. Migrating these notes here as I can use them on GitHubs mobile app making info more portable / future-proof

## Resources and Templates
Template examples for different files with more manual / comples setups, hopefully will reduce time and increase coherency for future projects of these types.

## Technical Writing
More technical ramblings and ideas for things to make, also includes more CompSci theory that has interested me / been useful in studying.
