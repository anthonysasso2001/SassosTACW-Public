Technical and Creative Writings, just random ideas that I want to write with no promise of correctness or degree of finality... Ranges anywhere from LaTeX technical papers to random .txt notes to code examples of potential implementations.

# Overview of writings and brief descriptions:

## 1. IF-Then-Else-Then Bridgeable Locality
<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>

### Brief:
This is an idea I had from having the first example (carrying vars that should have been local), and not being able to google a solution. Now I know that it was solvable through lambdas but even then, this still serves as an interesting solution and better where lambdas are too heavy-handed for a minimal solution

### Goals:
The main goal was on how to bridge locality between two cases where shared code in between the cases is not complex enough for a helper function but it is unpreferred to copy the code...

### Connected implementation (if applicable):
Yet unimplemented, but does not seem too difficult given the ability of most pre-compilers in using regex-like expressions...
    
### Notes & Considerations:
Should read the document as ambivalent to the specified coding language and paradigm (used functional C++ due to it being standard (especially due to the number of languages that borrow its syntax), and not wanting to get stuck into the weeds with different language examples...

## 2. Multi-Programming Analogy
<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>

### Brief:
This was an analogy from class, and I thought of writing it down to save myself time in remembering it. In addition, it could prove useful for other individuals who had similar difficulties understanding the concepts statically.

### Goals:
Represent multiprogramming solutions/methodologies in a simple, very abstract way. This is to help individuals who have trouble differentiating them or are inexperienced in the concept of multiprogramming itself

### Connected implementation (if applicable):
Highly likely findable on Geeks4Geeks W3Schools or similar programming sites, no point implementing it myself...

### Notes & Considerations:
N/A

## 3. Multi Packet Transfer
<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>

### Brief:
I was having trouble thinking not only about HOW to do an LDT (large data transfer) but wanted to look at the mathematical implications for one.

### Goals:
Represent large data transfers on a structural level and look at a way to "calculate" the potential sizes needed for different packages (which could prove useful for a 'time to deliver' message or other algorithms).

### Connected implementation (if applicable):
May make a generic option for this using C++ since I will reuse said source in the future, yet unimplemented.

### Notes & Considerations:
This is not under active development and due to time commitments will remain that way for a while... possibly after I do have more free time or am actively coding a solution for such a problem, I will update this at the same time.
