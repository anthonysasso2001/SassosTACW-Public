    \section{Introduction / Concept}
       This mainly came about from fundamentally disagreeing with the concept of debate as it exists culturally. In addition to modern debate's effect on how people consider beliefs, compare opinions, and does not make accounts for unknown fundamentally disparate occurrences (whether linguistic or experiential).

    \bigskip
        The order of this document will be thus:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Outlining of my opinions of the contrast of human knowledge using the framing of set theory, and a potential origin of disagreement as a result.

        \item How this can create unequal debate formats that necessarily cannot allow for meaningful understanding.
        
        \item A possible debate format structure that could reduce a few of the noticed effects, and potential negatives from it.
        
        \item Conclusion and further considerations.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \section{Human knowledge through set theory}
        To begin, we will begin with some axioms required for this document to be read directly:
    
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item Two humans cannot by their nature understand to a fundamental level another person's lived experiences, opinions, or the fragment of the origin of their thought, irrespective of their similarities.
        
        \item When required humans cannot understand the atomic origins of their feelings, philosophies, and beliefs; but that this does not demean or discount the meaningfulness of anecdotal, lived beliefs.
        
        \item If exposed to an unknown, or unknowable experience humans must respond, and this will not allow or create said understanding. (this being the supposition specific occurrences are by their nature unknowable to non-involved members).
        
        \item Discrepancies in understanding create conflict, and this conflict can never be removed through competitions of meaning.
        
    \end{enumerate}
